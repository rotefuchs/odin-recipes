The most unappealing recipes website.<br>
Just a simple and neat website, designed to display the most unbelievable and wackiest recipes one could find online.<br>
<br>
Knowledge I tried to apply while constructing this humble website:<br>
- boilerplate's<br>
- headlines<br>
- paragraphs<br>
- bold and italic<br>
- relative and absolute links<br>
- images
